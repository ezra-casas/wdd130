      <p>I'm currently living in Washington State, USA. Currently waiting for my contract to renew; I've been working as a Internal Software Developer mainly using Python, JavaScript, SQL, ReTool located in Texas for about 7 months. 
I've just finished a personal project for iOS in swift that I'm hoping to publish by before the end of the month. I also wanted to try out Rust language. I stumbled upon wanting to create a script to remove duplicated entries from a CSV file with specific parameters based on headers selected. This was quite fun to build, though difficult as I haven't done or focused in low level languages. 
 
I decided to get a degree most companies where I'm at have been requiring it and to also understand the fundamentals of development.</p>
