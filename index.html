                I'm currently living in Washington State, USA. Currently waiting
                for my contract to renew; I've been working as a Internal
                Software Developer mainly using Python, JavaScript, SQL, ReTool
                located in Texas for about 7 months. I've just finished a
                personal project for iOS in swift that I'm hoping to publish by
                before the end of the month. I also wanted to try out Rust
                language. I stumbled upon wanting to create a script to remove
                duplicated entries from a CSV file with specific parameters
                based on headers selected. This was quite fun to build, though
                difficult as I haven't done or focused in low level languages. I
                decided to get a degree most companies where I'm at have been
                requiring it and to also understand the fundamentals of
                development.

                Known for it's trees, Washington adopted the name "Evergreen
                State". It rains what feels like 365 days a year. Also famous
                for the sighting of Sasquatch.
